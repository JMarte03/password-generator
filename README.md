# 🔑   Password Generator App

This is a React Native app that allows users to generate strong passwords based on customizable options. Users can select the password length (between 4-16 characters) and specify whether the password includes lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or symbols. The app also has options to reset the form.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React Native, Formik, Yup

This app is built with React Native and focuses on form management and validation:

- **React Native:** To build the app interface and manage component-based structure.
- **Formik:** For handling the form state and user input.
- **Yup:** For schema-based form validation.
- **useState Hook:** For managing the dynamic state of the form options and generated password.

### Key Features:
- Input password length (4-16 characters).
- Choose password criteria: lowercase, uppercase, numbers, symbols.
- Generate password with a button.
- Reset the form with a reset button.

## Optimizations

In future iterations, we could add functionality to copy the generated password to the clipboard or display password strength based on the criteria chosen. Another potential enhancement could be saving user preferences for future password generations.

## Lessons Learned:

This app helped me understand form handling in React Native using Formik and the useState hook. I also learned about schema validation with Yup to ensure user input follows the correct format.
