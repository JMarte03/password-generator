# 🔒   Password Generator App

This is a React Native app that allows users to generate strong passwords based on customizable options. Users can select the password length (between 4-16 characters) and specify whether the password includes lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or symbols. The app also has options to reset the form.

This app is built with React Native and focuses on form management and validation:

- **React Native:** To build the app interface and manage component-based structure.
- **Formik:** For handling the form state and user input.
- **Yup:** For schema-based form validation.
- **useState Hook:** For managing the dynamic state of the form options and generated password.

### Key Features:
- Input password length (4-16 characters).
- Choose password criteria: lowercase, uppercase, numbers, symbols.
- Generate password with a button.
- Reset the form with a reset button.

## 🧠  Lessons Learned:

This app helped me understand form handling in React Native using Formik and the useState hook. I also learned about schema validation with Yup to ensure user input follows the correct format.
